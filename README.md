This is the last project in the React.js section of The Odin Project's curriculum.
The main goal here was to make a functional shopping cart, the rest is secondary.
The second goal here was to implement react-router-dom, that's why the project has a homepage.
All products are obtained from [Fakestoreapi](https://fakestoreapi.com) and then rendered as products in the store page.
